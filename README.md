# Overview
store-api is a REST API for an online store that serves as the backend for the frontend application store-front. The API handles operations related to data management, business logic, authentication, authorization, and communication with the database. It is the central component of the system, which, together with the store-front application, forms a comprehensive e-commerce solution. By clearly separating the frontend and backend, the API enables scalability, security, and easier maintenance of the application, allowing for independent development and updates of both parts of the system.

# Tech Stack

### [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)
Used as the main framework for building the API (handling HTTP requests, managing routing, implementing middleware for request processing, and facilitating authentication and authorization processes).
### [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/)
Used as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to facilitate data access and management within the application. This technology simplifies interactions with the SQL Server database and handles database migrations, data modeling, and CRUD operations.
### [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/sql-server)
Used as the primary relational database management system for storing and managing the application's data.
### [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault) + [Azure Identity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/category/identity)
Used for securely managing secrets, keys, and certificates, and enabling secure access through Azure Active Directory, without hardcoding credentials in the application.
### [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/)
Used for automating the mapping between different object models, such as mapping data transfer objects (DTOs)
### [FluentValidation]
Used for validating data inputs through a fluent API, ensuring that incoming data meets defined rules.
### [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
Used for generating interactive API documentation that imitates the frontend of the site. 
### [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr)
Used for enabling real-time communication between the server and clients to get response from API about stripe payment status.
### [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us)
Used for sending emails within the application (register link, order summary etc.)
### [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-pl/payments?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrp-3BhDgARIsAEWJ6SzEJY3t2l_U8Hdfr-6kuBQf6xmxxmZKtARm5GSB6Zrquclw8qkIKSYaAgS1EALw_wcB)
Used for processing payments and handling transactions.
### [JwtBearer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer?view=aspnetcore-8.0)
Used for implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, which is used in the process of user authorization.
